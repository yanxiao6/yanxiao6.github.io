<h2>About me</h2>
<p>My current research focus is evaluating the trustworthiness of deep learning systems including trustworthiness evaluation for autonomous driving, deep neural network repair for improving the accuracy of models, input discrimination for deep learning systems.
    My research is within the domain of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence in application domains related to software bug localization, software code readability, software integration test, data mining, and big data analysis. My researches are undertaken in a broad spectrum of application domains, such as self-driving cars, deep neural network analysis, and hydrological data analysis.
